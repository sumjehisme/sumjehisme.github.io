            <p>Wanna look good when you go to school? Feeling frustrated as you end up looking tired and de-energised?</p>
            <p>It's okay, let me be your guide throughout your makeup journey!!&#x2765</p>


            <h2>1 Cleansing your face</h2>

            <p>&#9885 Cleansing is the essential step before doing your beautiful makeup! By using a <strong>foam making net</strong>, I create bubbles with the cleansing milk, in order to clean my pores thoroughly.</p>
            <img src="https://biodazur.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/ffee00f0f48926720bd81e66f77d1384/f/i/file.jpg" width="250" height="208">
            <h4>You can easily get one if these foam making bags from <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/FRCOLOR-Handmade-Cosmetic-Exfoliating-Scrubber/dp/B0CPYT8QSF">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.taobao.com/list/item/753848634531.htm">Taobao</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Soap-Net-Bag-Mesh-Soap-Saver-Bags/1591226950">Walmart</a> and many other online stores.</h4>
            <img src="https://medias.watsons.com.hk/publishing/WTCHK-811380-front-zoom.jpg?version=1707377518" width="250" height="250">
            <h4>SANA Soy Milk Face Cleansing Foam helps clean my pores. It also gives an instant brightening effect!</h4>
            <p>&#9885 Gently rub your face with the foam, especially on those spots that usually get oily!</p>
            <p>&#9885 After briefly 30 seconds, rinse your face with lukewarm tap water.</p>
            <p class="standout">Remember: hot water is detrimental to your skin barrier, so you must not wash your face with it, even in winter!</p>

            <h2>2 Face care routine</h2>

            <p>&#9885 This step is very important, if you don’t want cakey makeups like this:</p>
            <img src="https://preview.redd.it/06icavhv2om31.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6e2b1eceb5f7872aba327ed19184cac01268d5a0" width="200" height="275">
            <p>&#9885 This step needs to be done at least <strong>10 minutes</strong> prior to your makeup, to let your face absorb the moisture.</p>
            <p>&#9885 Here’s my usual routine: Vitamin C Hydration Water ➨ Hada Labo Gokujyun Toner ➨ Tea tree oil ➨ Vaseline ➨ <strong>10 minutes break</strong> (i usually eat breakfast during the break lol&#9786;) ➨ Sunscreen</p>

            <ol>
                <h3>2.1 Lip moisturising</h3>
                <p>&#9885 Put vaseline on your lips as a lip balm. It keeps your lips from cracks for the entire school day!</p>
                <p class="standout">Even if you’re not putting on any makeup, this step is still A MUST.</p>
                <img src="https://assets.unileversolutions.com/v1/1474787.png" width="188" height="188">

                <h3>2.2 Acne treatment</h3>
                <p>&#9885 I also use tea tree oil to deal with my pimples. Before covering them up with concealer, make sure to apply the oil onto your acne first.</p>
                <img src="https://media.thebodyshop.com/i/thebodyshop/1033443_1033438_TEA_TREE_OIL_A0X_AEU_10ML_BRONZE_NW_INAEVPS055?$product-zoom$&fmt=auto" width="200" height="245">
                <h4>Recommendation: tea tree oil of THE BODY SHOP</h4>

                <h3>2.3 Sunscreen</h3>
                <p>&#9885 Besides blocking your skin from UV, sunscreen acts as a separation layer between your skin and the makeup.</p>
                <p class="standout">Even if you’re not putting on any makeup, this step is also A MUST!</p>
            </ol>

            <h2>3 Natural “No-makeup” Makeup</h2>
            <p>&#9885 Finally, here's the spicy part of your morning routine – makeup!</p>
            <p>&#9885 However, as we're doing this for a school day, we'll definitely try to maintain as natural as possible, reaching the“no-makeup”effect.</p>
            <ol>
                <h3>The Outline - "B4" </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Base</li>
                    <li>Blush</li>
                    <li>Bags under eyes ("Aegyo-sal")</li>
                    <li>Baby pink lips</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3.1 Base</h3>
                <p>&#9885 Choose a long-wear foundation that is close to your own skin tone. That's right, don't go for colours that are way too pale, you might end up having a huge colour contrast between your face and your neck!</p>
                <p>&#9885 To find and purchase the perfect foundation for your skin tone, I recommend <a href="https://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/foundation-finder.html">NARS Shade Finder</a> for you. Truly a life saver!</p>
                <p>Apply the foundation as <strong>one thin layer</strong> each time, to avoid getting a cakey finish. Then, use a damp beauty blender to spread it all over your face.</p>

                <h4>Song Hye-gyo is definitely top-tier pretty, but the colour of her neck differs from that of her face...can be really awkward tbh.</h4>

                <h3>3.2 Blush</h3>
                <p>&#9885 Use a low-saturation coloured blush <strong>that matches your lipstick colour</strong>.</p>
                <p>&#9885 A simple formula to applying blush: <strong>6V</strong>. The picture below is how you put the 6V shapes on your face. You may also draw a thin line above your nose tip for extra aesthetics!</p>

                <h3>3.3 Bags under eyes ("Aegyo-sal")</h3>
                <p>&#9885 A famous saying goes "you can go without your eyeliners and stuff, but you can't give up your <strong>aegyo-sal</strong>", which is actually true if you want to look more energised and youthful! Here's a detailed aegyo-sal tutorial:</p>

                <h3>3.4 Baby pink lips</h3>
                <p>&#9885 By "baby pink", I actually mean sticking your lip colour to a natural tone, that is <strong>not over saturated</strong>! Or else you might look like this:</p>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/3a/7d/e1/3a7de1d3a65e321dc563b55ff17efebe.jpg" width="236" height="350">

                <p>&#9885 Here are the steps to get watery, plump lips:</p>

                <h4>1. Put a thin layer of concealer over your lips.</h4>
                <img src="E:\Jodie DSE\jodie's file (DONT DELETE)\jodie bu schoolwork\comm2036\IMG_1377.jpg" width="384.5" height="384.5">

                <h4>2. Cover your lips with powder(I use INNISFREE No-Sebum Mineral Powder).</h4>
                <img src="E:\Jodie DSE\jodie's file (DONT DELETE)\jodie bu schoolwork\comm2036\IMG_1378.jpg" width="384.5" height="384.5">


                <h4>3. Draw <strong>6V</strong> again but on lips.</h4>
                <img src="E:\Jodie DSE\jodie's file (DONT DELETE)\jodie bu schoolwork\comm2036\IMG_1379.jpg" width="384.5" height="384.5">

                <h4>4. Blend the colours with you finger -- the best lip blender!</h4>
                <img src="E:\Jodie DSE\jodie's file (DONT DELETE)\jodie bu schoolwork\comm2036\IMG_1380.jpg" width="384.5" height="384.5">
                <h4>(Also drawn by meee &#169 2024)</h4>

                <h3>3.5 Setting spray</h3>
                <p>&#9885 To ensure your makeup doesn't fall of halfway through school, setting spray must be the last crucial step of your glow up.</p>
                <img src="https://d1flfk77wl2xk4.cloudfront.net/Assets/10/358/XXL_p0088335810.jpg" width="220" height="220">
                <h4>SO NATURAL Make Up Setting Mist is your go-to spray to lock your makeup and hydration.</h4>
            </ol>
